# Keil Assistant

[marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WTL568594290.keil-assistant-2026)
### Fork from [keil-assistant](https://github.com/github0null/keil-assistant)
Due to the original plugin no longer being updated and encountering some issues during use, the project was forked and some modifications were made for ease of use.
- When adding a project, you can choose to generate the path *of the generated c_cpp_properties. json file relative to the keil uvproj file, which was previously generated in the directory where the uvproj file is located*
- Remember the path to the keil uvproj file, and use this path to open the keil project when opening any file. *The dialog box for adding a project originally defaults to the path where the current open file is located*
- Add two C51 snippets to prevent interrupt x errors
  - isr interrupt handler function
  - INTERRUPT interrupt vector macro

### Start 🏃‍♀️

1. Create a project on Keil, add files, header path, etc
> 
2. Click **Open the Project** icon or **Use Vscode to directly open the directory where keil project file (.uvproj) is located**, and the keil project will be automatically loaded by the plug-in;

### Common operations

- **Compile and burn**：Three buttons are provided, one for compile, one for download, and one for recompile
 
 ![build](./res/preview/build.png)

>

- **Save and refresh**：Add/delete the source file, change and configure the project on Keil. Click **Save all** when the change is finished. The plug-in will automatically refresh the project when it detects the change of the Keil project

>

- **Toggle the C/C++ plug-in configuration**：Click the target name to toggle between multiple C/C++ configurations
 
 ![cpp_config](./res/preview/cpp_config.png)

>

- **Switch keil Target**：Click the project toggle button to toggle between multiple Keil targets
 
 ![active_target](./res/preview/active_target.png)

>

- **Show reference**：After compilation is complete, you can expand the reference by clicking on the arrow icon for the source item (ARM project only)

### Other settings

- Workspace Settings: Project exclusion list(`KeilAssistant.Project.ExcludeList`)
 When there are multiple Keil projects in a directory, open it with the plug-in, and the plug-in loads all keil projects. This option allows you to specify which Keil projects you want to exclude, preventing the project from being automatically loaded when the workspace is opened
 **The default exclusion list**：
  ```json
  [
      "template.uvproj",
      "template.uvprojx"
  ]
  ```
